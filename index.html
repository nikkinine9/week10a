        <h1>READING FACES</h1>
        <article class="eyes">
            <h3>Stare into their eyes</h3>
            <p>
                When reading a face, you'll want to start with the eyes, the most suggestive of all facial features. You'll learn a great deal about a person's mood by paying close attention to their eyes. The pupils dilate during moments of stimulation, or in low lighting.
                If you are in a location with constant light, notice shifts in pupil size. A large pupil suggests some sort of arousal or interest. Our pupils shrink when we see something offensive or negative. This constriction blocks off any unwanted
                images. A person may squint if they do not like you or what you're saying. They also may be suspicious of your words and actions. If you notice this occurring, address the issue and clarify what you're saying. A darting eye suggests insecurity
                or discomfort. You can also detect these feelings through sideways glances. Any break in eye contact proves that a person isn't fully present.

            <h3>Notice the lips</h3>
            <p>
                Lip muscles are extremely delicate and shift to reflect various moods and reactions. When a person begins to speak, their lips will part slightly. Pay attention to this, as you always want to be open and available when someone wants to speak with you.
                A lip that points inward is called a pursed lip. The pursed lip indicates tension, frustration, or disapproval. A person with a pursed lip is restraining whatever emotion they are experiencing, effectively holding the words back by tightening
                their lips. Puckering the lips into a kiss shape indicates desire. A puckered lip may also suggest uncertainty, as can a sucked in lip. This is often referred to as "swallowing the lips." Pay close attention to grimaces or twitching in
                the lips. While very slight, these tiny changes indicate cynicism or disbelief in circumstances. A liar will also give themselves away with a slightly twitching lip.

            <h3>Assess the motion of the nose</h3>
            <p>
                While the nose changes less than the eyes or lips, its central location on the face makes it easy to read. The flared nostril is a common shift. When it widens, it allows more air to pass in and out, preparing a person for combat. Flared nostrils indicate
                that a person is experiencing anger or displeasure. The nose may wrinkle as a result of a bad smell. Beyond the literal interpretation, a metaphorical "bad smell," such as an unpleasant sight or thought, causes the nose to wrinkle. If
                a person is thinking, they may wrinkle their nose when they have a thought that they don't approve of. Sometimes, blood vessels in the nose will dilate, making the nose appear red and swollen. This will occur when a person is lying. They
                may also scratch their nose, irritating it further.

        <article class="eyebrows">
            <h3>Study the eyebrows</h3>
            <p>
                Often connected to the eyes, the eyebrows fit into a wide variety of body language communications. Despite the limited number of muscles attached to them, the eyebrows are highly visible and suggestive of different emotional states. The wrinkling of the
                forehead works in tandem with the eyebrows. If the forehead wrinkles and the eyebrows raise, the other person is likely questioning your behavior or surprised by their surroundings. When the eyebrows lower, the eyes will be slightly concealed.
                When paired with a lowered head, this suggests a desire to hide the motion of the eyes. Eyebrows that slope inward while being pulled down suggest anger or frustration. They also may suggest intense concentration. Look out for a horseshoe-shaped
                fold between the brow. Known as "Darwin's grief muscle," this peculiar symbol displays grief or sadness.

        <h1>EXPRESSIONS</h1>
        <article class="mex">
            <h3>Macroexpressions</h3>
            <p>
                When attempting to read a face, you'll want to start by looking for macroexpressions. A Macro expression typically lasts between 0.5 and 4 seconds. These expressions will take over the entire face, giving you the full experience of this emotion. These
                universal expressions include joy, surprise, contempt, sadness, anger, disgust, and fear. You've no doubt experienced these seven expressions, so you'll have an easy time reading them in a macroexpression. If a person is expressing these
                feelings through a macroexpression, they are most likely attempting to get you to respond to their emotion. In the case of sadness, they may be asking you to comfort them. If you're faced with a macroexpression of contempt, however, they
                might be trying to intimidate you. Know that it's easiest to manipulate a false emotion through macroexpression. Because it lasts longer, it's easier to settle into the performance of this emotion. Don't allow yourself to be deceived by
                false macroexpressions.

            <h3>Microexpressions</h3>
            <p>
                Microexpressions typically last between 1/15 and 1/25 of a second, making them much harder to detect in another person. While a macroexpression may reveal how someone is feeling, it's more likely that truth will be revealed in the microexpression. When
                someone attempts to conceal an emotion, there may be some "leakage" of their actual emotion. This slip typically occurs in the microexpression. If you aren't paying close attention to the face, you may miss the real emotion this person
                is feeling. If you're hoping to get a deeper understanding of a person, you must be sensitive to microexpressions. An intimate knowledge of how someone is feeling is crucial to developing sensitive personal relationships. While a macroexpression
                may tell the truth, there's a chance that a person may be trying to elicit a response by "putting on" this emotion. When paying close attention to microexpressions, you're less likely to miss the actual emotion.

            <h3>Understand Subtlety</h3>
            <p>
                Subtle expressions are even smaller than microexpressions, so detecting them requires a great deal of attention. These expressions arise before an emotion is even completely felt, coming as natural responses to ones' surroundings. Subtle expressions also
                may not be a full expression of one emotion. In a microexpression, a full emotion flashes for a short period of time. A subtle expression, however, may only contain pieces of a full emotion. These tiny expressions may be key to discovering
                deception, as the slightness of their occurrence can be concealed more easily than a microexpression.
